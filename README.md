# Mini Python Projects
An assortment of python programs. I did most as part of learning books, tutorials, tests, challenges, or boredom.

# Featured Programs

* Ceaser Cipher: Encrypts a message with the ceaser cipher.
* Coin and Dice: A program I made when I first started python. It just simulates a coin flip or dice roll.
* Deduction Game: A game where you guess a three digit number.
* Dice Roller: Basically just the dice roller from above, but with ASCII graphics.
* File Creator: Makes a basic python file with basic class and functions
* Fizz Buzz: Prints a response based on if a number is divisible by three, five, both, or neither.
* Garbage Pile: Random functions I made that only have a few use cases and are normally replaceable by built in functions.
* Hangman: Just a game of hangman with ASCII art.
* High or Low: Another game I made as a beginner. You just guess whether the next random number will be higher or lower than the current.
* Mad Lib: My madlib game I made when starting out.
* Magic PyBall: A magic 8 ball made in python. It also has some extra responses
* Pig-Latinify: Turns a sentence into pig latin. This is what happens when you let a programmer get bored in class.
* RPS(Rock Paper Scissors): Just a game of rock paper scissors.
* Random Competition Code: A collection of coding challenges from competions and stuff. I only keep them because I can, they are kinda neat, and they at least kinda prove I know what Im doing.
* Slot Machine: Got it out of a programming book and made it a bit more personal. Overall just a fake slot machine.
* Taxes: Calculates taxes but I dont know helpful it is
* Tempurature Converter: Converts a temp from one type to the others.
* TicTacToe: Just basic tick tac toe. You cant beat the bot if it goes first, only tie. First person to prove me wrong, send me a video or some other kind of proof. It is easy to beat if you go first though
* Website Name Slicer: Slices a URL into a nice looking website name.
* Word Counter: Counts words in a given sentence.

# How to use programs
You have two-way to do this depending on what you intend on doing

***Do this if you want to edit them and add your own features or flair***
   
-Download the zip, unzip it, and open files in VSCode, Pycharm, IDLE, or another python capable code editor. From here you can run the code from the editor and edit what ever you want to customize.

***Do this if you don't want to edit them***
   
-Make sure you have python downloaded

-Open Download the zip and unzip it.

-Open up the terminal and type in cd followed by the exact file location of the files EX: cd /User/Docments/SomeDudesCode/Mini-Python-Projects 

-Type python followed by the file name EX: python hangman.py

-Hit enter and have fun
